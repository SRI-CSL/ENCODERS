External library dependencies for Android
=========================================

The files in this directory are used to build external library
dependencies for Haggle on the Android platforms. These libraries are
not provided with the Android NDK, which means they must be built
separately before Haggle can be built. The dependencies include:

* zlib
* sqlite
* openssl
* libcutils (Android specific)
* dbus
* bluetooth

To build, make sure you have Git (git.kernel.org) and the Android NDK
installed on your system. Then simply run the build.sh script and
follow any instructions.
