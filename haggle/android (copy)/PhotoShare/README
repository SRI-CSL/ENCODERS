PhotoShare

Compilation
===========

If the Android SDK is found in the path during configure, PhotoShare will
automatically be compiled.

Manually (make or ant):

> ant debug -lib ../../lib/org.haggle.jar


Eclipse:
For compilation with Eclipse, you need the Android SDK installed.  You also
need to setup the path to the libhaggle java bindings. First build libhaggle
with the Java bindings, then point Eclipse to the haggle.jar file that is
built. This is done under 'Project->Properties->Java Build Path' in Eclipse.
