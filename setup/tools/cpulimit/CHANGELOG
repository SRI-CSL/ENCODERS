=========== Changes in 2.1 ================

* Added the --quiet (-q) flag to make 
limitcpu run silently

* Install as "limitcpu" not "cpulimit"

=========== Changes in 2.0 ================

* Added the -- flag to make sure child processes
  run with command line flags would not confuse
  cpulimit.

* Corrected output of child process name in verbose mode.

=========== Changes in 1.9 ================

* Swapped out __MACH__ pre-compiler flag for __APPLE__ to
  avoid conflicts with GNU Hurd.


* Added --kill (-k) and --restore (-r) flags to allow
  target processes to be killed and restored rather than
  simply throttled.

* Made sure version number is accepted from Makefile.

=========== Changes in 1.8 ================

* Added separate build targets for Linux, FreeBSD and OS X.
  See the compiling section of the README file.

* Applied patch from FreeBSD to our upstream code to make
  future updates on FreeBSD easier.

* When displaying verbose output, cpulimit now redisplays
  the column headers every 20 lines.

* Fixed limiting CPU usage on multicore machines when
  the desired usage limit is great than 100%.
  ie A machine with 4 cores can now properly limit
  multi-threaded applications to, say, 150% or 250%.

* Added test application (busy). See "test" directory.
  To build the test software, run "make tests".

* Removed memrchr() call to allow program to compile on OS X.

* Updated Makefile to work with OS X.

* Fixed OS X compiler error. Macs do not understand
  CLOCK_REALTIME

* Added patch from Debian which added compiler flags. This
  should "harden" CPUlimit on Debian.
  Thanks to Gregor for supplying this patch.


============= Changes in 1.7 ===============

* Minor code cleanup.

* Make sure we do not try to throttle our own process.

* Added "tarball" option to the Makefile to assist
  in packaging. Moved version number to the makefile.

* Added version information to CPUlimit's help screen.

* Detect the number of CPU cores on the machine and
  cap the % we can limit. 1 CPU means we can
  limit processes 1-100%, 2 means 1-200%, 4 means 1-400%.

* Removed extra priority changes. We now only bump
  our priority once, if we have access to do so.
  Also simplified priority increases so it's flexible
  rather than "all or nothing".

* Since we now attempt to detect the number of CPUs
  available, we also give the user the ability to
  override our guess. The -c and --cpu flags have
  been added for this purpose.

* Commands can be launched and throttled by appending
  commands to the end of CPUlimit's argument list. For
  example:
  cpulimit -l 25 firefox


======== Changes in 1.6 ============

* Updated copyright notice in README file.

* Made sure we define a reasonable buffer size
  if PATH_MAX is not already defined. Fixes
  building on Hurd.


======== Changes in 1.5 ============

* Updated man page and cpulimit's "--help" page to
  reflect support for multi-core CPUs.

* Added example of using cpulimit in a shell
  in the man page and the README file.

* The Makefile now uses the default compiler
  on the system, "cc", and tries to fall back
  on gcc if no other compiler is found.


======== Changes in 1.4 ============

* We can now accept limits of 100% or higher. Useful for multi-core
  systems.

* Perform sanity check when getting jiffies. Should prevent memory
  errors if we cannot open proc data.

* Added copyright to README.


========== Changes in 1.3 ============

* Updated license information in cpulimit.c and README file

* The -b flag is now shown under options instead of targets
  in the help text.

* Include man page from Debian with updates.


========= Changes in 1.2 ===========

* Applied Debian patch for checking to see if and how much we can
  adjust our own process priority.

* Added LICENSE file so there wouldn't be any confusion about
  what license CPUlimit uses.

* Applied Debian's patch for long options to avoid segfault.

* Applied Debian's Makefile patch.

* Added Debian patch to avoid opendir leaks.

* Added -b command line parameter to make CPUlimit 
  run in the background, returning control the the 
  user's terminal.

* When cpulimit is launched with one PID to track
  once that process no longer exists, CPUlimit
  will exit. Same behaviour as though the lazy
  flag was set.

* Ported CPUlimit to FreeBSD


======= cpulimit-1.1 released ============

* Fixed a segmentation fault if controlled process exited in particular circumstances
* Better CPU usage estimate
* Fixed a <0 %CPU usage reporting in rare cases
* Replaced MAX_PATH_SIZE with PATH_MAX already defined in <limits.h>
* Command line arguments now available
* Now is possible to specify target process by pid
